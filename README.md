ABSTRACT
Bridges, tunnels, and flyovers play a critical role in transportation infrastructure, facilitating the efficient movement of people and goods. However, these types of structures are prone to various kinds of harm, with cracks being a common cause for concern. Concrete structures form the backbone of infrastructure development in Bangladesh, playing a vital role in supporting economic growth and ensuring public safety. However, the presence of cracks in concrete poses significant challenges to the integrity and durability of these structures. The research begins by curating a diverse dataset of concrete crack images, which serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the CNN models. Various data preprocessing techniques are applied to enhance the dataset's quality and balance. Subsequently, several state-of-the-art CNN architectures, including VGG16, VGG19, MobileNetV2, InceptionV2, and a specialized model CrackNet, are evaluated in terms of accuracy and efficiency for crack detection. The conventional techniques for crack monitoring are frequently labor-intensive, time-consuming, and can be subject to human error. This thesis explores the application of deep learning techniques to automatically monitor cracks in bridges, tunnels, and flyovers, offering a more efficient and reliable solution. The objective is to develop an automated system that can detect, classify, and monitor cracks, enhancing the safety and longevity of these vital structures. The implications of this research are significant for the maintenance and preservation of Bangladesh's concrete infrastructure. By automating the crack detection process, it is anticipated that early identification of cracks and timely intervention can be facilitated, mitigating potential risks and extending the lifespan of concrete structures. Furthermore, the findings of this study contribute to the growing field of deep learning-based concrete crack detection and can serve as a valuable reference for future research and development in the domain of infrastructure management and safety.
